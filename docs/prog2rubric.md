|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/edu-setu-group26-proj2/tree/main/docs|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.||
